Nomic
=====

Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.

This Repo
=========

This repository is a template and set of initial rules for playing a game of correspondence nomic hosted on github. The initial set of rules are very similar to the [initial rules provided by the game's author](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial%20set), Peter Suber, with slight modification so as to fit more comfortably within github.

How To Play
===========

Before the game starts:
1. Create a game specific repo by forking this repo.
1. Grant each player write access to the game repo.
